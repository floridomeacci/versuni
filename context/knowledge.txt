Understanding the Philips 'Made for the Homemakers' Campaign: A Simple Guide

1. The Starting Point: Why Does Philips Need a New Campaign?

Philips has long been a trusted brand, but in a crowded market, simply being known is no longer enough to win at the moment of choice. This left the brand "vulnerable and forgettable." The core problem was self-inflicted; as Philips put it, "We are our own clutter." By telling too many separate product stories, the brand was competing with itself for attention, and the messages weren't adding up to one clear identity. This resulted in "shrinking mindshare," with global brand preference falling from 38.6% to 35.2% despite significant investment. To solve this, Philips decided on a major shift in its strategy.

2. The Big Shift: Moving from Function to Feeling

The campaign's strategy is to transform Philips from a company that simply makes appliances into a brand that enables a better home life. It's a fundamental move away from talking about technical features and toward building a meaningful, emotional connection with people.

The Old Way: Appliance Maker	The New Way: Home Enabler
Focus on "features and functions"	Focus on becoming an "emotional choice"
A brand known for being functional	A brand that elevates everyday home living
Trusted, but forgotten at purchase	Builds an emotional connection to be remembered

This new emotional focus is aimed at a specific group of people Philips calls 'homemakers'.

3. Who is a 'Homemaker'?

This campaign is for "all homemakers, in all their diversity and roles." The term is used inclusively to describe anyone who performs the small, everyday acts that make a house feel like a home.

An "act of homemaking" is defined as: "Anything that makes a house feel like home; everyday acts of appreciations, typically unseen and unnoticed, but that are so important."

Examples of these acts include:

* Making a daily coffee for yourself or a loved one
* Cooking your partner / family / roommates' favorite meals
* Comforting a friend by making them dinner in their home
* Steaming or Ironing your clothes before a family dinner
* Cleaning the floor after your daughter’s sweet sixteen

The campaign is built on one simple but powerful insight about what these acts of homemaking truly mean.

4. The Core Idea: What Makes a House a Home?

At the heart of the campaign is a universal human truth that competitors, in their constant fight over features and functions, had completely overlooked. The core brand idea is this:

We know that what truly makes a home are the people that live there. Not by constructing it brick by brick, but by doing all the small things that make it feel like home.

Philips sees these everyday efforts as nothing short of noble: small, heroic gestures that quietly transform a house into a home. The brand's purpose, therefore, is to design products that "support and celebrate the homemaker in all of us." With this core idea, the campaign aims to achieve several key goals over time.

5. What Success Looks Like: The Campaign's Goals

The 'Made for the Homemakers' platform is designed to build brand value progressively, with clear objectives for the short, medium, and long term.

1. Short-Term Impact: The initial goal is to increase top-of-mind awareness and begin building positive emotional associations for the brand, such as warmth, understanding, and reliability.
2. Medium-Term Impact: Over time, the campaign aims to drive higher consideration and preference for Philips products. This shift will be driven by the new emotional connection, not just a functional comparison of features.
3. Long-Term Impact: The ultimate vision is for Philips to become "synonymous with homemaking." This strong brand identity is expected to lead to higher penetration in its key product categories.

The ultimate goal is to transform brand perception from "Philips makes good appliances" to something much more personal:

Philips gets what home means to me.

6. Final Takeaway

The 'Made for the Homemakers' campaign is more than just an advertisement; it's a "unifying platform" for the entire Philips portfolio. By shifting the focus from the technical specs of its appliances to the meaningful rituals of home life, Philips aims to build a deeper, more lasting connection with people. It’s a strategic move that celebrates the small, everyday acts that turn a house into a home, repositioning the brand from being about products to being about the people who use them.


Strategic Plan: The 'Made For The Homemakers' Campaign

1.0 The Strategic Imperative: Redefining Philips' Place in the Home

This is an unprecedented moment for our business. For the first time, we are unleashing the full power of the Philips portfolio with a unifying platform designed to drive significant and sustained category growth. This document architects the strategic plan for the 'Made For The Homemakers' (MFTHM) campaign, a pivotal shift engineered to solve a core business problem: in a market where brand relevance is paramount, Philips has become fragmented and emotionally distant. Here, we diagnose the challenge that necessitates this new foundation for growth.

1.1 The Market Landscape and Competitive Challenge

Philips, a brand at the heart of homes for over 130 years, now operates in a market crowded with sharper, louder competitors. This environment is defined by a relentless "constant fight over features and functions," a battleground on which it is impossible to build lasting brand value.

Our central strategic problem is that being passively "known when asked" is no longer sufficient. It is a position of weakness that leaves the Philips brand "vulnerable and forgettable in moments of choice." To reverse our decline and reclaim leadership, we must transition from a familiar name to a distinctive, top-of-mind brand that commands emotional preference.

1.2 The Philips Brand Disconnect: Declining Mindshare Despite High Trust

The primary challenge we confront is a fundamental paradox: while consumer trust in Philips products remains high, our emotional connection to the brand is weak, leading directly to declining mindshare. This disconnect is evidenced by several critical factors:

* High Investment vs. Shrinking Mindshare: Despite a significant annual global investment of ~€XM across more than five categories, global brand preference has been steadily falling from 38.6% to a projected 35.2%.
* Internal Fragmentation: By telling too many separate product and category stories, the brand has become its "own clutter." This fragmented approach ensures that the more we say, the less memorable any single message becomes, diluting the impact of our marketing investment.
* The Emotional Gap: The core issue is that "People trust Philips products, but don’t feel much for the brand nor have it come to mind easily." This lack of emotional resonance has a direct and damaging commercial consequence: "Trust without emotional connection = forgotten at purchase."

1.3 The Strategic Opportunity: From 'Appliance Maker' to 'Home Enabler'

These market challenges reveal our strategic opportunity: to pivot the brand's perception and purpose. We must orchestrate a transformation of Philips from a functional "appliance maker" into an essential "home enabler"—the brand that actively "elevates everyday home living."

This transformation will be driven by two primary strategic goals:

1. Become the emotional choice, not just the functional one.
2. Be thought of in more category entry points (places, and spaces).

To seize this opportunity and reverse our decline, we have developed a new, unifying brand platform: 'Made For The Homemakers'.

2.0 The Core Campaign Platform: A New Foundation for Growth

To address our strategic imperative, we need a single-minded, memorable, and emotionally powerful creative platform that enables us to be meaningful, distinctive, and consistent across all categories. This section details the foundational insight and core creative idea of the 'Made For The Homemakers' campaign. It is a platform architected to move beyond a commoditized features narrative and forge an authentic emotional connection that our functionally focused competitors cannot replicate.

2.1 The Universal Human Insight

At the heart of our brand strategy lies a deep and universal human truth that has been completely overlooked by the rest of the category:

“A house is made a home by all of the small everyday things we do to make it feel that way”

This insight provides Philips with a unique and ownable emotional territory, allowing our brand to connect with consumers on a level that transcends product specifications.

2.2 The Core Brand Idea

Flowing directly from this insight is our core brand idea. Philips recognizes that what truly makes a home are the people who live there—not through grand gestures, but through the countless small, everyday actions that infuse a space with life and meaning.

Therefore, our brand makes a clear commitment: Philips designs products to "support and celebrate the homemaker in all of us." Every time a person makes coffee, cooks dinner, or cleans up, they are performing an important act of homemaking, and Philips is there to make it less demanding and more rewarding.

2.3 The Brand's Role and Global Resonance

Our defined role for the Philips brand is to empower and support all homemakers in creating a home of "love, comfort and joy." This idea is not limited by culture or geography; it resonates deeply and universally. Qualitative feedback from consumers across diverse markets confirms the power of this positioning:

* In Germany, a homemaker noted, "We bring life to our homes through the things we do and the appliances we use."
* From Turkey: "What makes a house feel like a home is thinking about the people in the house and doing things that will make them happy."
* In Indonesia, creating the "warmth of a home" was described as having "a very deep meaning" because it leads to a harmonious family.
* A homemaker from the Netherlands reflected on how high-quality devices "created moments of connection and warmth," contributing to "the essence of our home."

This universally understood role is captured in our official campaign tagline:

Philips, Made for the homemakers.

This platform provides the foundation for building a deep and lasting connection with the audience it is designed to engage: the everyday homemaker.

3.0 Target Audience: The Everyday Homemaker

This section defines the target audience for the 'Made For The Homemakers' campaign. Our strategy is built on a deep understanding of this audience's core mindset, which is crucial for creating communication that feels authentic, resonant, and genuinely supportive of their lives.

3.1 Audience Demographics and Psychographics

Our primary target audience is broadly defined as "everyday homemakers 25+." This is an inclusive and diverse group that reflects the modern reality of home life. It includes, but is not limited to:

* Young families establishing their first real homes.
* Busy professionals seeking efficiency without sacrificing quality.
* Mature homemakers reinventing their spaces.
* Anyone who values the small, meaningful rituals that make a house feel like home.

3.2 Core Audience Mindset

The defining characteristic of our target audience is their core mindset: they believe authentic progress is more valuable than perfection. Their homes are not showrooms to be admired; they are spaces that are lived-in, loved-in, and worth investing in.

This audience feels the external pressure to chase an unrealistic standard of perfection, but what they truly crave are homes that work for real life, with all its beautiful messiness. They are building lives, not just decorating spaces, and they seek brands that understand and support that journey. Our communications objective is therefore architected to meet this mindset directly:

* Get: Everyday homemakers
* Who: are building lives, not just spaces
* To:
  * Think: Philips supports all homemakers in the little things they do to make home feel like home.
  * Feel: Warm, understood, and supported.
  * Do: Actively seek out Philips over competitor brands.
* By: Building deeper emotional connections with people.

This clear strategic directive informs the creative strategy designed to connect with our audience on an emotional level by acknowledging their reality and celebrating their efforts.

4.0 The Creative Construct: Building a Distinctive and Memorable Brand World

A powerful idea requires disciplined execution. To succeed, the 'Made For The Homemakers' platform must be supported by a consistent, ownable, and memorable creative framework. This section outlines the core principles, tone, and rules that will ensure all communications build on each other, generating maximum compound effect and establishing an unmistakable brand world for Philips.

However, a creative approach centered on "real life" carries significant strategic risk. If we just show real people doing real everyday things, our communications will quickly become boring. Worse, they will blend into the sea of sameness within the category, rendering our investment ineffective. Our creative construct is therefore not merely a choice, but a sophisticated solution designed to avoid this trap and build a truly distinctive brand.

4.1 Guiding Principle: Real Life Authenticity

"Real Life Authenticity" is the creative core of the platform. Our mission is to move beyond the polished, sterile depictions of home life common in the category and instead uncover and celebrate the "un-curated and beautiful truths of homemaking," complete with all its quirks and imperfections.

The goal is to connect with our audience by reflecting their reality in an unexpected and memorable way. By tapping into the true underlying motives and emotions behind everyday acts of homemaking, our creative will evoke a "wry smile of recognition," signaling to our audience that Philips truly understands them.

4.2 Tone of Voice: The Four Pillars of Communication

Our communications will be guided by a tone of voice defined by four key traits, ensuring a consistent and relatable personality across all touchpoints:

1. Proudly Humble: Our products are important characters in the story, but the true spotlight is always on the homemakers and their acts of care.
2. Light-hearted: We are joyfully relatable, finding the optimism and warmth in everyday moments.
3. Welcoming: We democratize homemaking, celebrating all homemakers in their diverse roles and realities.
4. Genuine: We show the real world without sugar-coating, presenting authentic situations in an unexpected and memorable way.

4.3 Creative Execution Rules

To deliver consistent impact, all brand and category communications must adhere to a clear set of creative rules. These rules are designed to build and reinforce our distinctive brand assets over time.

Creative Element	Execution Guideline
Brand World	A unique "Home of Homes" concept, showing an interconnected set of diverse homes to celebrate the universality of homemaking.
Focal Point	Always hero-ing homemakers and the daily, important acts of homemaking that transform a house into a home.
Storytelling	True and authentic storytelling that goes beyond the obvious, revealing the deeper emotional truths of everyday life.
Brand Assets	Consistent and prominent use of our strong distinctive assets: the Proud Wordmark, the Spark, and the signature Philips Blue color. Music and Voice are assets to be built.

This creative blueprint will be carried to market through a strategic, multi-layered media approach designed for maximum impact.

5.0 Media and Implementation Strategy: Driving Growth Across the Funnel

The media strategy for 'Made For The Homemakers' is not a single event, but a long-term communications ecosystem. This approach is engineered to build brand equity and emotional connection over time, while simultaneously fueling category growth, converting preference into sales, and delivering a strong return on investment.

5.1 The Communications Construct: A Multi-Layered Growth Ecosystem

Our strategy is built on a three-layered communications construct, with each layer playing a distinct but complementary role in driving growth:

* Cross-category Brand: Tells the highest-level universal story, demonstrating Philips' overall positioning in the home. It uses categories as the reason to believe within the homemaking narrative to drive brand preference.
  * KPI: Top-of-Mind Awareness (TOMA) to drive brand preference.
* Category: Heroes our innovation and connects key emotional and functional benefits to specific category entry points. It drives perceived value and reinforces the brand story in a relevant context.
  * KPI: Mental availability to convert preference into demand & sales.
* Product Portfolio: Showcases specific products and provides clear reasons to buy. This layer takes center stage to drive transactions and capture demand.
  * KPI: Profitable sales.

5.2 The Kick-Off Campaign: Phased Rollout and Objectives

"Increasing your surface area of exposure to positive upside optionality” —Rory Sutherland

The platform will launch with a "desire only cross category campaign" designed as a bold statement of intent to build emotional connection. This initial brand-building phase will be followed by full-funnel category campaigns that connect this newfound brand equity directly to sales. The strategic focus of this kick-off is clear and disciplined:

This Campaign IS...	This Campaign IS NOT...
Premium big screen AV emotional brand building	Digital-only lower attention channels
Consistent, building compound returns for the future	A one-off campaign expecting immediate ROI
Leading seasonal moments (4-6 weeks ahead of peak)	Reacting to competitors during peak periods
Focused on 30" & 20" TVC films that build brand equity	Short-form content without brand building

5.3 Market Implementation Guidance

The role of the MFTHM brand campaign will vary based on the maturity and strategic goals of each market. The following provides guidance for implementation:

* Leader Markets ('Defend & Shape'): The campaign focus is to sustain leadership by keeping the brand top-of-mind and reinforcing its cultural authority. This protects penetration against challengers and ensures new product launches are framed within a leadership context.
  * Risk of Inaction: Distinctiveness erodes, penetration plateaus, and recovery costs escalate as challengers gain relevance.
* Scaler Markets ('Expand'): The focus is on moving Philips toward the default choice. The campaign creates broad visibility, extends mental availability across categories, and makes product-focused advertising more effective by reinforcing brand salience.
  * Risk of Inaction: The brand gets stuck in "consideration, not choice," product campaigns lose efficiency, and competitors leapfrog ahead.
* Entrant Markets ('Break In'): The primary focus must be on category communication first. The brand campaign should only be considered when building a presence beyond two or more categories, where it can efficiently drive awareness and build legitimacy.
  * Risk of Inaction: The brand remains invisible, and individual product launches struggle to establish legitimacy on their own.

5.4 Projected Business Impact and ROI

This new communications construct is designed for significant commercial impact. Based on analytical scenario planning, the campaign is estimated to drive an incremental Return on Investment (ROI) that ramps up to +10-25% versus our current fragmented approach. This projection is supported by broader industry research and OMG case studies, which show that strong brand campaigns can drive an uplift of up to 25-30% on overall marketing ROI. The success of this strategy will be rigorously tracked through a comprehensive measurement framework.

6.0 Measuring Success: From Functional Metrics to Emotional Connection

The success of the 'Made For The Homemakers' campaign will be measured by a clear and demonstrable shift in both quantitative business metrics and qualitative brand perception. The framework below outlines the key performance indicators across multiple time horizons, all leading to our ultimate goal: a fundamental transformation of the relationship between consumers and the Philips brand.

6.1 Key Performance Indicators

Success will be tracked against a series of short, medium, and long-term indicators that measure our progress from building awareness to driving penetration.

1. Short-Term Impact:
  * Increased Top-of-Mind Awareness (TOMA) metrics.
  * Growth in positive emotional brand associations, specifically warmth, understanding, and reliability.
2. Medium-Term Impact:
  * Higher consideration and preference for Philips within key categories, driven by a stronger emotional connection rather than purely functional comparison.
3. Long-Term Impact:
  * Philips becomes synonymous with homemaking—the brand people instinctively think of when they think about making their house feel like home.
  * Higher penetration and sustained growth in our key categories.

6.2 The Ultimate Goal: Transforming Brand Perception

While these metrics are critical for tracking performance, the ultimate measure of success for this strategic plan is a fundamental shift in how consumers perceive and relate to our brand. We will have succeeded when we transform the dominant brand perception from:

"Philips makes good appliances"

to

"Philips gets what home means to me."



Executive Summary: 'Made for the Homemakers' (MFTHM) Campaign

1.0 Introduction: A Unifying Strategy for Growth

The 'Made for the Homemakers' (MFTHM) campaign is an unprecedented, strategic initiative for the Philips portfolio. This document outlines the business case, core strategy, and financial projections for our first-ever multi-product campaign, an architecture engineered to consolidate our brand narrative into a singular, powerful asset that will unlock superior marketing ROI and drive profitable, portfolio-wide growth.

At its core, MFTHM is the first time Philips is unleashing the full power of its portfolio under a unifying platform designed to make the brand work harder and drive category growth. This initiative is our decisive response to a critical market challenge that threatens our brand’s long-term health and competitive position.

2.0 The Strategic Imperative: Addressing Shrinking Mindshare

To grasp the imperative for this campaign, we must first confront the market realities that have eroded our brand equity. Despite Philips' legacy, consumer trust, and significant marketing investment, key performance indicators reveal a critical vulnerability in a market crowded with sharper, more focused competitors.

The core business problem can be distilled into three key areas:

* Declining Brand Preference: Despite an annual global investment of approximately €XM across 5+ categories, our global brand preference has fallen from 38.6% to 35.2%. This decline is a clear indicator of shrinking consumer mindshare.
* Brand Fragmentation: By telling multiple, disconnected product stories, we have inadvertently become our "own clutter." This fragmentation is particularly dangerous for a generalist brand like Philips, which must compete against specialist competitors who are synonymous with their single categories. In this environment, our lack of a single, powerful narrative makes us our own worst enemy.
* The Emotional Disconnect: While consumers trust the functional performance of Philips products, they lack a strong emotional connection to the brand itself. This leaves Philips vulnerable and "forgettable in moments of choice."

The ultimate risk of inaction is clear: if Philips does not build distinctiveness and forge a deeper emotional connection, our communications will remain ineffective. This leaves the brand exposed to sharper, louder competitors. This vulnerability, however, exposes a clear strategic mandate: to redefine our relationship with consumers on our own terms.

3.0 The Core Idea: From "Appliance Maker" to "Home Enabler"

The MFTHM platform is the direct strategic response to these challenges. The campaign pivots away from the category's conventional "battle over features & functions" to connect with a deeper, universal human truth about the meaning of home.

This strategy is built on a foundational insight that resonates globally:

“A house is made a home by all of the small everyday things we do to make it feel that way.”

This insight enables a fundamental shift in our brand positioning, transforming how consumers perceive and interact with Philips.

From	To
An "appliance maker"	A "home enabler"
A functional choice	An emotional choice

Our new brand role is to empower and support the "homemaker in all of us." We will achieve this by designing and marketing products that celebrate the small, everyday acts that transform a house into a home. This repositioning is encapsulated in the campaign tagline: Philips, Made for the homemakers. To bring this powerful idea to life, we have developed a distinctive creative and communications framework designed for maximum impact.

4.0 Creative & Communications Framework

To ensure the MFTHM idea is not only understood but also memorable and ownable, it requires a unique creative execution and a structured communications plan. These elements are designed to work in concert to create a powerful compound effect, elevating both the brand and its product categories.

The creative approach is defined by a core principle and a clear tone of voice:

* Core Principle: Real Life Authenticity. The creative will celebrate the "magical theater of everyday home life," embracing its un-curated quirks and imperfections. This principle is a deliberate choice to cut through the category's "sea of sameness." While competitors focus on sterile product demonstrations, we will create an ownable emotional territory by celebrating the authentic, un-curated moments of home life, ensuring our creative evokes a "wry smile of recognition" and is both relatable and memorable.
* Tone of Voice: Our communications will embody four key traits: Proudly Humble, Light-hearted, Welcoming, and Genuine.

This creative vision will be deployed through a multi-layered communications construct, where each layer serves a distinct business objective and is measured by a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI):

1. Cross-Category Brand: This top layer drives overall brand preference by demonstrating Philips' unifying position across all home categories. Its primary KPI is Top of Mind Awareness (TOMA).
2. Category: This layer converts brand preference into active demand within specific product categories, heroing innovation to drive perceived value. Its primary KPI is mental availability (ensuring Philips comes to mind easily and instinctively across multiple purchase occasions).
3. Product Portfolio: This foundational layer focuses on driving conversion by highlighting specific products and their reasons to buy. Its primary KPI is profitable sales.

This integrated framework ensures that every communication contributes to a single, cohesive narrative, directly linking our strategic vision to tangible financial outcomes.

5.0 Projected Business Impact & ROI

The integrated brand-and-category architecture is engineered to deliver a significant uplift in marketing effectiveness and return on investment. By building brand equity at the top of the funnel, we will create a multiplier effect that makes every dollar of category-specific spending work harder.

The specific, data-driven ROI projections from our analytical scenario planning are as follows:

* Baseline ROI: The current Category Media Only ROI stands at 3.39.
* Projected Incremental ROI: The MFTHM construct is estimated to drive an incremental ROI of +10% to +25% over the baseline.
* Scenario-Based Projections: Analytical modeling projects a campaign ROI of 3.73 in a "Pessimistic" scenario and 4.24 in an "Optimistic" scenario.

Beyond the numbers, the ultimate goal of the campaign is to fundamentally shift consumer perception. We aim to transform the prevailing mindset from "Philips makes good appliances" to "Philips gets what home means to me." This evolution from a functional provider to an emotionally resonant partner is the key to securing long-term, sustainable growth.

6.0 Conclusion: A Landmark Business Opportunity

The 'Made for the Homemakers' campaign is more than a marketing initiative; it is a strategic, unifying platform engineered to reverse brand decline, build a lasting emotional connection with consumers, and drive significant, measurable category growth. By consolidating our message and speaking with a single, authentic voice, we will cut through the clutter and re-establish Philips as an indispensable part of the modern home.

Therefore, the precise execution of this platform is not merely an opportunity; it is the critical lever we must pull to amplify the entire Philips product ecosystem and secure our long-term brand leadership.


Made for the Homemakers: The Story of Philips' Brand Transformation

Introduction: A Trusted Friend Facing a Modern Challenge

For over 130 years, Philips has owned a rare and valuable asset in the consumer mind: trust. But in a fragmented modern marketplace, the brand discovered a dangerous truth: functional trust doesn't guarantee a place in the shopping cart. Philips was respected, but it wasn't desired. The strategic diagnosis was clear, revealing a critical disconnect at the heart of the brand.

People trust Philips products, but don’t feel much for the brand... Trust without emotional connection = forgotten at purchase.

What follows is a breakdown of how Philips navigated this critical inflection point, moving from a brand people respected to one they might finally love.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. The Problem: Fading in a World of Noise

Even for an established giant, the modern market presented significant challenges that were causing its message to get lost.

1.1 Losing the Battle for Attention

Philips found itself competing in a market crowded with "sharper, louder competitors." While the brand was still well-known, it was discovering a harsh truth of modern marketing: being "'known when asked' isn’t enough" to win customers at the moment of choice. Without a distinctive and memorable presence, the brand risked fading into the background.

1.2 A Story in Fragments

The external challenge was compounded by an internal one: a fragmented brand story that was undermining its own efforts.

* Creating its own "clutter": By telling many separate stories for its 5+ product categories, Philips was inadvertently making its overall message less memorable. The core strategic challenge was this: as a generalist brand, Philips was competing against specialists who are synonymous with their categories. In that environment, a fragmented message wasn't just noise; it was a guarantee of being forgotten.
* Shrinking Mindshare: Despite significant global marketing spend, this fragmented approach was leading to a clear decline in global brand preference, which fell from 38.6% to 35.2% between 2020 and 2025. "Brand preference" is a simple measure of how likely a customer is to choose your brand over a competitor, and this decline was a clear signal that the existing strategy was no longer working.

The strategic imperative was clear: Philips needed to find a single, powerful idea to unify its voice and reclaim its place in the hearts and minds of consumers.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. The Opportunity: From "Appliance Maker" to "Home Enabler"

To solve its identity crisis, Philips committed to a fundamental shift in purpose. The goal was no longer to be seen as a company that simply makes appliances, but as a true partner in creating a home.

2.1 A New Purpose

The strategic decision was made to transform Philips from a functional "appliance maker" into an emotional "home enabler." This transformation was driven by two primary goals:

1. Become the emotional choice: The brand needed to stand for something more than just performance and features, building a genuine emotional connection with its audience.
2. Be present in more moments: Philips wanted to be thought of more often and in more "places, and spaces" around the home, becoming synonymous with the very idea of homemaking.

2.2 Discovering a Universal Truth

To find this new direction, the company looked past the industry's "constant fight over features and functions." Instead of focusing on technology, they searched for a deeper human truth about what home really means. They found it in a simple, powerful insight that was being completely overlooked by the entire category.

“A house is made a home by all of the small everyday things we do to make it feel that way.”

This insight—that the true essence of a home lies in the small, daily rituals and acts of care—became the fulcrum for the entire brand pivot. This simple idea gave Philips the key to unlock a more meaningful and authentic brand story.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. The Big Idea: Celebrating the Homemaker in All of Us

With a new purpose and a powerful human insight, Philips launched a unifying creative platform: "Made for the Homemakers."

3.1 A New Brand Promise

The new core idea is simple yet profound: Philips designs products to support and celebrate the homemaker in all of us. This promise re-frames everyday chores as meaningful acts. Every time you make coffee for a loved one, cook a family dinner, or clean up crumbs after a celebration, you are doing one of the most important things you can do—making a house your home.

3.2 An Idea That Resonates Globally

This idea of celebrating the small, everyday acts of homemaking proved to be universally powerful, resonating deeply with people from different cultures all over the world.

* Germany: "We bring life to our homes through the things we do and the appliances we use.”
* Turkey: “What makes a house feel like a home is thinking about the people in the house and doing things that will make them happy.”
* Indonesia: “Creating the warmth of a home... with the warmth of a home a harmonious family will be created.”
* Netherlands: "My child loved helping with our shiny new coffee machine, which made mornings magical with its aroma and the sounds of brewing coffee. These devices weren’t just functional, they created moments of connection and warmth."

3.3 The New Role for Philips

The brand's new role became crystal clear: to empower and support homemakers in creating a home filled with love, comfort, and joy. This mission was captured in a simple, direct tagline: Philips, Made for the homemakers.

But a powerful idea is only as good as its execution. Philips now faced the challenge of bringing this newfound soul to life in a way that felt as authentic as the insight itself.

4. Bringing the Story to Life with a New Voice

To translate its new promise into memorable communication, Philips needed a distinctive personality and a clear set of creative principles.

4.1 A Focus on Real Life

The core of the new creative platform is "Real Life Authenticity." The brand chose to celebrate the "magical theater of everyday home life," complete with all its "quirks, imperfections, and all." However, the strategy acknowledged a significant risk: if you just show real people doing real everyday things, it can quickly become boring and "blend into the sea of sameness within the category."

The creative challenge, therefore, was to be authentic without being mundane. Philips needed a voice that could find the extraordinary in the ordinary.

4.2 The Four Traits of the Philips Voice

To solve this challenge and ensure every communication was both authentic and memorable, the brand's new tone of voice was defined by four key traits:

Trait	Meaning
Proudly Humble	Our products are characters in the story, but the spotlight is on homemakers.
Light-hearted	We are joyfully relatable.
Welcoming	We democratize homemaking.
Genuine	Show the real world in an unexpected and memorable way.

This unique voice ensures that every piece of communication not only tells the brand's story but does so in a way that feels distinctively human and stands apart from the competition.

5. Conclusion: A Brand That "Gets What Home Means"

The "trust without emotional connection" gap is a common pitfall for legacy brands. Philips’ journey provides a masterclass in bridging it, not with louder feature claims, but with a quieter, more profound understanding of the human heart of the home. By shifting its focus from appliances to the small, heroic gestures that turn a house into a home, Philips found a powerful, unified voice in a crowded market.

The ultimate goal is to transform brand perception from "Philips makes good appliances" to "Philips gets what home means to me."

In doing so, Philips has wholeheartedly dedicated itself to the people who are the true heart of any home: the homemakers.
